# observable -- see what's lagging your server

This is a spiritual successor to [LagGoggles](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/laggoggles) for Minecraft 1.16 (and hopefully later versions). Licensed under MPLv2.

No builds yet, as there are still a few things to fix.

TODO:

- Fix the jar shadowing to bundle in the imgui libraries
- Fix the 3 us/t overhead I probably introduced in the last commit
- Fix the in-game overlay not updating when the player switches dimensions
